## Introduction
I was born in Brazil and moved to the US when I was 12 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology with a focus on wetlands ecology, but I have been working as a research analyst for the past 4 years - I've decided to dive deeper into data science to support my professional work.  

I had to take a break for a semester because of work responsibilities, but I'm glad to take the Data 201 course and continue my work for the Data Science certificate. 

### Some of my Hobbies 
- Reading
  - The book I most recently finished was *Scaramouche*, by Rafael Sabatini
- Writing
  - I'm trying journaling this year, it's been a lot of fun!
- Drawing and painting
  - I used this hobby for my Data 110 art project:
    ![Data 110 Project](https://github.com/ddezouza/Data110/blob/ed541e91085beee91e76a324998bf61abeaed0b7/Art%20Project/ProjectImage.jpg)
- Watching movies
  - I recently watched the extended editions of The Lord of The Rings in cinema. It was a great experience, I highly recommend it!

### Favourite Quotes
I like reading a lot, so here are some of my favourite quotes: 

>Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit attrocities.
>
>--Voltaire

>There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.
>
>--Arthur Conan Doyle

>All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
>
>-- J.R.R. Tolkien

### Plans for 2026
I didn't have a great start to 2026, but I've made some plans for the rest of the year: 

1. Finish Data Science Certificate at MC
2. Get a new job
3. Finish Cybersecurity certifications
4. Apply for Data Science masters at UMD
5. Go to Brazil 

As I was recently laid off from my position at  [ACA Aponix.](https://www.acaglobal.com/our-solutions/cybersecurity-privacy-risk)[^1] I have been looking for other options. But I decided not to let that get me down and have been actively pursuing my hobbies and classes in the meantime.
[^1]:ACA Aponix is a branch of GRC advisory services company ACA Group. Aponix is the business unit focused primarily on cybersecurity. 

### Coding
I'm excited to work more with python. I've only used it in Data 110 so far, but it's very versatile and I'm excited about what else I can do with it.  

I wonder if there's something like R's 'swirl' package for quick python practice?  It essentially lets you take different pre-programmed courses directly through the R console,  
Here's the code to install the package and bring it up: 

```R
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
swirl()
```
I'll be working through the datacamp course but it'd be interesting to see if there are options built directly in python.  

### Reading Goals for 2026
I've decided to read more in 2026: 

- [x] Read at least 1 book in January
- [x] Read 1 novel and 1 long audiobook (more than 20 hours) in February.
- [ ] Read at least 3 non-fiction books by June 
- [ ] Start 1 sci-fi series before July
- [ ] Finish reading the Game of Thrones series before watching 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms'  

### All that remains is a Table
Tabes kind of suck in markdown, but I made one. I remember at the end of Data 110 we had a short discussion of the differences between Tableau and Python for data visualization.  

Here are some Pros & Cons of classes online: 

| ***Python***                          | ***Tableau***                                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Very versatile good for statistics not just visualization.       | Intuitive, easy to play with.       |
| Requires knowledge of data to know how to build your data frames and work with it in code.               | Information is apparent, you can drop pieces of data and see what works              |


### In Conclusion
This assignment was time consuming, but I did learn a lot.
