## Introduction
I was born in Brazil and moved to the US when I was 12 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology with a focus on wetlands ecology, but I have been working as a research analyst for the past 4 years - I've decided to dive deeper into data science to support my professional work.  

I had to take a break for a semester because of work responsibilities, but I'm glad to take the Data 201 course and continue my work for the Data Science certificate. 

### Some of my Hobbies 
- Reading
  - The book I most recently finished was *Scaramouche*, by Rafael Sabatini
- Writing
  - I'm trying journaling this year, it's been a lot of fun!
- Drawing and painting
  - I used this hobby for my Data 110 art project:

- Watching movies
  - The last movie I watched was *I'm Still Here*, Directed by Walter Salles 

### Favourite Quotes

### Learning in 2025
2025 has started as a pretty heavy year learning-wise for me. I'm currently taking lots of different classes, including of course this one. 
Here are all the classes I'm taking currently: 

1. Data 101
2. Data 110
3. ISC2 Cybersecurity Certified Certification Course
4. Beginner Mandarin for Adults

This may not seem like much for a full-time student, but I also have a full-time job!! 

As I mentioned, I'm currently working as a Research Analyst for a consulting company called [ACA Aponix.](https://www.acaglobal.com/our-solutions/cybersecurity-privacy-risk)[^1]
[^1]:ACA Aponix is a branch of GRC advisory services company ACA Group. Aponix is the business unit focused primarily on cybersecurity. 

### Coding
The only coding experience I had before this class was working with R for my biostatistics classes in college. Needless to say, I have no experience using Python and this is my first time actually working with markdown as well. Hopefully I'll get the hang of things. 

I was pleasantly surprised to be working with R once again for Prof. Alraee's Data 101 class. Our first homework was using a package called "swirl" `install.packages("swirl")`. It essentially lets you take different pre-programmed courses directly through the R console, which was really interesting. 
Here's the code to install the package and bring it up: 

```R
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
swirl()
```
I'm looking forward to learning some Python through this class. 

### Goals for 2025
In 2025 I had/have a few personal and professional goals: 

- [x] Earn an Exceeds Expectations performance rating for 2024
- [x] Lead production of 2 new webinars before June 19th (work anniversary).
- [ ] Get promoted :) 
- [ ] Earn Cybersecurity Certified ISC2 certification
- [ ] Finish classes for MC Data Science Certificate
- [ ] Dedicate more time to my hobbies 

### All that remains is a Table
Since we were pre-warned tables in markdown are a pain, I left this as my last section. 

Here are some Pros & Cons of classes online: 

| ***Pros***                          | ***Cons***                                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Convenient, no need to drive.       | Uses Zoom which can have technical issues.       |
| Classes are recorded.               | Sharing screen doesn't always work.              |
| All materials available online.     | No direct interaction with everyone else.        |

### In Conclusion
This assignment was time consuming, but I did learn a lot.
