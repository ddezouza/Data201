While R has different packages (like the vegan package), you only really call up the package the first time and so there's no continuous iteration of what packages the functions you are using are coming from. Having to directly reference the packages in python to properly use the formulas makes a lot of sense because for a lot of things you'll be using a combination of packages for different things. I think it makes it easier to keep track of what you're actually doing because the packages have their own functionality."
